# Overcast
A low-level systems programming language tailored to improve your workflow and make coding a breeze.

# Features
Currently, Overcast is in an early development stage, so a lot of features are still to be implemented.
However, so far Overcast contains quite a few useful features:
	* Functions
	* Structs
	* Variables
	* If Statements
	* Binary Expressions

We've still got a lot more planned(loops, bitwise operations, modules, etc.), so stay tuned!

# Contributions
We welcome contributions to the language and encourage them. 
To see what needs to be done, you may go to the issues section and find a problem you'd like to help solve.
We try to review pull requests quickly, but it's not always possible, so just in case, please have some patience!
